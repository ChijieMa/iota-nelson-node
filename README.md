# iota-nelson-node with docker-compose

This repository contains the docker-compose file to get started with an iota node enhanced through Nelson

Nelson is a tool meant to be used with IOTA's IRI Node.
It automatically manages neighbors of your full node, negotiating connections,
finding new neighbors and protecting against bad actors.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of iri - the iota node with nelson up and running on your local machine using docker and docker-compose.

### Prerequisites

It is expected that you have already installed docker, docker-compose
and know how to start and use it.

## More information

Please refer to the [iri project](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri) or [nelson project](https://github.com/SemkoDev/nelson.cli) for more information about the configuration files.
